      "howToPlayText": "Chess Online Multiplayer follows the classic rules of chess. The goal of the game is to checkmate your opponent’s king, putting it in a position where it is under threat of capture and has no legal moves to escape.\n\n**Getting Started**\n\n1. **Choose the game type:**\n* play online against other players;\n* challenge the computer;\n* play together on the same screen with a friend.\n\n2. **If you’re playing against the computer:**\n* select the opponent’s difficulty level (from Beginner to World Champion);\n* choose whether to use a handicap and interactive hints.\n\n3. **If you’re playing with a friend:**\n* decide on the time control mode (Unlimited, Bullet, Blitz, Rapid, Classic).\n* choose your bet\n\n**Basic Rules and Gameplay**\n\n* Players take turns making moves.\n* Pawns move forward and capture diagonally.\n* Knights move in an «L» shape.\n* Other pieces have their own unique moves.\n\nTo succeed, develop a strategy: protect your pieces, control the center of the board, and anticipate your opponent’s moves.\n\nThe game ends when one player checkmates the opponent’s king (winning the game) or when a draw is achieved under certain conditions.\n\n**Draw Conditions**\nA draw is a result where neither player wins, and the game ends in a tie. It can occur under the following circumstances:\n* **stalemate:** when a player has no legal moves but is not in check;\n* **three-fold repetition of the position:** when the same position occurs three times;\n* **50 moves without a capture or pawn move;**\n* **insufficient material to checkmate;**\n* mutual agreement between players.\n\n**Special Chess Moves**\n\n**Castling**\nCastling is a special move involving the king and a rook. It can be performed only if:\n* neither the king nor the rook has moved yet;\n* there are no other pieces between the king and the rook;\n* the king is not in check;\n* the king does not pass through or stop on squares that are under attack.\n\nThis move helps to protect the king and connect the rooks for better defense.\n\n**En Passant (Taking on Pass)**\nEn passant is a special pawn capture. If your opponent moves a pawn two squares forward and lands next to your pawn, you can capture it on your next move as if it had moved only one square. Your pawn will take its place, but this capture must be done immediately.\n\n**Additional Features**\n\n* **Made a mistake?** Use the move undo function to reconsider your strategy.\n* After each match, a detailed analysis highlights mistakes and suggests better moves.\n* You can replay specific moments to strengthen your understanding of the game.\n* Save your rating and choose different time modes (Bullet, Blitz, Rapid).\n* Customize the board and pieces to your liking.\n* Review the move history and express your emotions by communicating with your opponent using playful cartoon emojis.",
