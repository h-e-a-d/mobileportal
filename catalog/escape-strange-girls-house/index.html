                                <summary>What is Escape Strange Girl’s House?</summary>
                                <p>Escape Strange Girl’s House is a free online puzzle game that you can play directly in your web browser. Escape Strange Girl’s House is a dark point-and-click adventure available on both web and Android.

You wake up in a locked, unfamiliar house. The windows are sealed, the doors are bolted, and it doesn’t take long to realize you’re not here by choice — you’ve been kidnapped. The only way forward is to explore, uncover clues, and piece together who lives here… and why they’ve trapped you.

Every object can hide a secret: a sofa may conceal something beneath its cushions, a flowerpot may hold a key, or a book on the shelf may reveal disturbing truths about the strange girl who owns this place. Interacting with the environment unlocks new paths, changes the protagonist’s perception, and pushes the story into darker territory.

As in every classic point-and-click adventure, you’ll collect items and use them in clever ways to solve puzzles, repair devices, and access new rooms. A simple glass of water, a sharp knife, or a roll of tape could be the difference between staying trapped forever and finding your way to freedom.

The narrative unfolds gradually, shifting from calm exploration to mounting dread. What begins as a harmless search of a living room turns into a chilling discovery of obsessions, sinister secrets, and unsettling mannequins that seem far too lifelike.

Your ultimate goal is clear: escape the house before it’s too late. But as you progress, you’ll uncover more about the girl’s twisted hobbies — and the terrifying fate that might await you if you fail.

Will you outsmart her and unlock the final door to freedom, or become just another part of her dark collection?</p>
