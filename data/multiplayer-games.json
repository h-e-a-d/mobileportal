      "howToPlayText": "Chess Online Multiplayer follows the classic rules of chess. The goal of the game is to checkmate your opponent’s king, putting it in a position where it is under threat of capture and has no legal moves to escape.\n\n**Getting Started**\n\n1. **Choose the game type:**\n* play online against other players;\n* challenge the computer;\n* play together on the same screen with a friend.\n\n2. **If you’re playing against the computer:**\n* select the opponent’s difficulty level (from Beginner to World Champion);\n* choose whether to use a handicap and interactive hints.\n\n3. **If you’re playing with a friend:**\n* decide on the time control mode (Unlimited, Bullet, Blitz, Rapid, Classic).\n* choose your bet\n\n**Basic Rules and Gameplay**\n\n* Players take turns making moves.\n* Pawns move forward and capture diagonally.\n* Knights move in an «L» shape.\n* Other pieces have their own unique moves.\n\nTo succeed, develop a strategy: protect your pieces, control the center of the board, and anticipate your opponent’s moves.\n\nThe game ends when one player checkmates the opponent’s king (winning the game) or when a draw is achieved under certain conditions.\n\n**Draw Conditions**\nA draw is a result where neither player wins, and the game ends in a tie. It can occur under the following circumstances:\n* **stalemate:** when a player has no legal moves but is not in check;\n* **three-fold repetition of the position:** when the same position occurs three times;\n* **50 moves without a capture or pawn move;**\n* **insufficient material to checkmate;**\n* mutual agreement between players.\n\n**Special Chess Moves**\n\n**Castling**\nCastling is a special move involving the king and a rook. It can be performed only if:\n* neither the king nor the rook has moved yet;\n* there are no other pieces between the king and the rook;\n* the king is not in check;\n* the king does not pass through or stop on squares that are under attack.\n\nThis move helps to protect the king and connect the rooks for better defense.\n\n**En Passant (Taking on Pass)**\nEn passant is a special pawn capture. If your opponent moves a pawn two squares forward and lands next to your pawn, you can capture it on your next move as if it had moved only one square. Your pawn will take its place, but this capture must be done immediately.\n\n**Additional Features**\n\n* **Made a mistake?** Use the move undo function to reconsider your strategy.\n* After each match, a detailed analysis highlights mistakes and suggests better moves.\n* You can replay specific moments to strengthen your understanding of the game.\n* Save your rating and choose different time modes (Bullet, Blitz, Rapid).\n* Customize the board and pieces to your liking.\n* Review the move history and express your emotions by communicating with your opponent using playful cartoon emojis.",

      "howToPlayText": "**How to Play English Checkers**\n\nEnglish Checkers is a strategic board game where players aim to capture their opponent’s checkers or block them completely. Here’s how to get started and understand the basic rules:\n\n**Game Objective**\nThe goal is to either capture all of your opponent’s checkers or completely block them so they can’t make any legal moves.\n\n**Types of Checkers**\n- **Simple checker:** moves diagonally forward one square and can only capture forward.\n- **King:** can move diagonally both forward and backward on any free square and can capture in both directions. When a simple checker reaches the last row, it becomes a king and gains these additional abilities.\n\n**Basic Movement and Capture Rules**\n1. **Movement:**\n- simple checkers move diagonally forward one square at a time;\n- kings can move diagonally in any direction on any free square.\n\n2. **Capture:**\n- if your checker is next to your opponent’s checker and there’s an empty square behind it, you must jump over the opponent’s checker and land in the empty square, capturing the opponent’s piece;\n- captures are mandatory — if you have the option to capture, you must do so;\n- if a capture leads to another possible capture, you must continue capturing as part of the same turn until no more captures are possible;\n- when a simple checker reaches the last row during a capture, it becomes a king but cannot make further moves in the same turn.\n\n3. **Choosing Capture Options:**\n- if there are multiple capture options available, you can choose which one to make;\n- the «Turkish strike» rule means that a checker that has been beaten but not yet removed from the board can block the path of a king or another checker.\n\n**Winning the Game**\nYou win the game by:\n- capturing all of your opponent’s checkers;\n- blocking your opponent so that they have no legal moves left.\n\n**Getting Started in English Checkers Online Multiplayer**\n1. **Choose your game mode:** play against the computer, compete online with real players, or play with a friend on the same screen.\n2. **Select your difficulty level or opponent:** if playing against the computer, choose from 10 difficulty levels; if playing online, find a real opponent.\n3. **Choose your side:** select whether you want to play as black or white.\n4. **Start playing:** follow the rules of movement and capture to outmanoeuvre your opponent and achieve victory.\n\nEnjoy the game and sharpen your strategic skills with English Checkers Online Multiplayer!",

      "description": "Durak is essentially a shedding card game where each player will try to get rid of the cards in their hand first. Durak is quite an enjoyable game that has over the years made a general impact on millions. It is a game that requires critical thinking, which is why it is more popular among people who consider themselves tech-savvy.\n\nThe objective of Durak is to play all your cards. The loser in Durak will be the last player with cards in their hand. So, to ensure you do not lose, try to act fast and get rid of your cards as soon as you can.\n\nDurak is the most popular Russian card game. Durak means fool and it refers to the person who loses the game.\n\nA Durak card game is one of the easiest and most fun card games. Players do not need much to get started. You will only need: a poker deck reduced to 36 cards from Ace to 6.\n\nHowever, this game is quite interesting because there will usually be multiple winners. To ensure you do not lose, try to act fast and get rid of your cards as soon as you can.\n\n\nDurak might not be a game you are overly familiar with. But in Russia, Durak is by far the most popular card game! It has got a fascinating history and will be sure to make a unique choice if you are looking for something a little different.\n\nAnother interesting thing about this game is that it is played with a smaller deck.\n\nDurak is fun and, rather, a unique card game. If you enjoy more strategic card games and are looking for something a little different, why not give Durak a try?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
      "howToPlayText": "Durak is played by 2 to 4 players. Total cards used are 36 cards - Only 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A of all suits are used.\n\nThe deck is shuffled, and each player is dealt with 6 cards. The bottom card of the stock is turned and placed face up on the table. The rest of the pack is then placed on half over the turn-up and at right angles to it, so that it remains visible. The trump suit is drawn as the last card.\n\nThe first person to play is the one who holds the lowest trump suit in his hand. The game proceeds in a clockwise direction. The player who started to play acts as an attacker and the player sitting next to him in a clockwise direction acts as a defender.\n\nThe player who has the lowest trump card will be the first attacker. If the attack succeeds, the defender loses their turn, and the attack passes to the player on the defender's left. If the attack fails, the defender becomes the next attacker. The attacker opens their turn by playing a card face up on the table as an attacking card. Defender responds to the attack with a defending card. A trump card of any rank beats all cards in the other three suits\n\nTo win Durak, you need to play all your cards quickly. Once you have played your cards, you are out of the game and will need to wait for the rest of the players. The last player with cards in their hand loses.",
