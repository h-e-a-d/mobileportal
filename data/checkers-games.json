      "howToPlayText": "**How to Play English Checkers**\n\nEnglish Checkers is a strategic board game where players aim to capture their opponent’s checkers or block them completely. Here’s how to get started and understand the basic rules:\n\n**Game Objective**\nThe goal is to either capture all of your opponent’s checkers or completely block them so they can’t make any legal moves.\n\n**Types of Checkers**\n- **Simple checker:** moves diagonally forward one square and can only capture forward.\n- **King:** can move diagonally both forward and backward on any free square and can capture in both directions. When a simple checker reaches the last row, it becomes a king and gains these additional abilities.\n\n**Basic Movement and Capture Rules**\n1. **Movement:**\n- simple checkers move diagonally forward one square at a time;\n- kings can move diagonally in any direction on any free square.\n\n2. **Capture:**\n- if your checker is next to your opponent’s checker and there’s an empty square behind it, you must jump over the opponent’s checker and land in the empty square, capturing the opponent’s piece;\n- captures are mandatory — if you have the option to capture, you must do so;\n- if a capture leads to another possible capture, you must continue capturing as part of the same turn until no more captures are possible;\n- when a simple checker reaches the last row during a capture, it becomes a king but cannot make further moves in the same turn.\n\n3. **Choosing Capture Options:**\n- if there are multiple capture options available, you can choose which one to make;\n- the «Turkish strike» rule means that a checker that has been beaten but not yet removed from the board can block the path of a king or another checker.\n\n**Winning the Game**\nYou win the game by:\n- capturing all of your opponent’s checkers;\n- blocking your opponent so that they have no legal moves left.\n\n**Getting Started in English Checkers Online Multiplayer**\n1. **Choose your game mode:** play against the computer, compete online with real players, or play with a friend on the same screen.\n2. **Select your difficulty level or opponent:** if playing against the computer, choose from 10 difficulty levels; if playing online, find a real opponent.\n3. **Choose your side:** select whether you want to play as black or white.\n4. **Start playing:** follow the rules of movement and capture to outmanoeuvre your opponent and achieve victory.\n\nEnjoy the game and sharpen your strategic skills with English Checkers Online Multiplayer!",

      "howToPlayText": "Moves are only allowed on dark squares, so pieces always move diagonally. Single pieces are always restricted to moving forward (towards the opponent).\nCapture pieces by jumping.\nA piece that makes a capture (jump) jumps over one of the opponent's pieces and lands in a straight diagonal line on the other side. Only one piece can be captured in one jump; however, multiple jumps are allowed in one move.\nJumps (or captures) are mandatory.\nIf a player can make a capture, the jump must be made.\n\nWhen a piece reaches the furthest row from the player who controls it, it becomes a king and can move either forward or backward.",
