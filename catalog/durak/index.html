                                <p>Durak is a free online cards game that you can play directly in your web browser.

Durak is quite an enjoyable game that has over the years made a general impact on millions.

Durak is the most popular Russian card game. Durak means fool and it refers to the person who loses the game.

A Durak card game is one of the easiest and most fun card games. Players do not need much to get started. You will only need: a poker deck reduced to 36 cards from Ace to 6.

However, this game is quite interesting because there will usually be multiple winners. To ensure you do not lose, try to act fast and get rid of your cards as soon as you can.


Durak might not be a game you are overly familiar with. But in Russia, Durak is by far the most popular card game! It has got a fascinating history and will be sure to make a unique choice if you are looking for something a little different.

Another interesting thing about this game is that it is played with a smaller deck.
