      "howToPlayText": "Chess Online Multiplayer follows the classic rules of chess. The goal of the game is to checkmate your opponent’s king, putting it in a position where it is under threat of capture and has no legal moves to escape.\n\n**Getting Started**\n\n1. **Choose the game type:**\n* play online against other players;\n* challenge the computer;\n* play together on the same screen with a friend.\n\n2. **If you’re playing against the computer:**\n* select the opponent’s difficulty level (from Beginner to World Champion);\n* choose whether to use a handicap and interactive hints.\n\n3. **If you’re playing with a friend:**\n* decide on the time control mode (Unlimited, Bullet, Blitz, Rapid, Classic).\n* choose your bet\n\n**Basic Rules and Gameplay**\n\n* Players take turns making moves.\n* Pawns move forward and capture diagonally.\n* Knights move in an «L» shape.\n* Other pieces have their own unique moves.\n\nTo succeed, develop a strategy: protect your pieces, control the center of the board, and anticipate your opponent’s moves.\n\nThe game ends when one player checkmates the opponent’s king (winning the game) or when a draw is achieved under certain conditions.\n\n**Draw Conditions**\nA draw is a result where neither player wins, and the game ends in a tie. It can occur under the following circumstances:\n* **stalemate:** when a player has no legal moves but is not in check;\n* **three-fold repetition of the position:** when the same position occurs three times;\n* **50 moves without a capture or pawn move;**\n* **insufficient material to checkmate;**\n* mutual agreement between players.\n\n**Special Chess Moves**\n\n**Castling**\nCastling is a special move involving the king and a rook. It can be performed only if:\n* neither the king nor the rook has moved yet;\n* there are no other pieces between the king and the rook;\n* the king is not in check;\n* the king does not pass through or stop on squares that are under attack.\n\nThis move helps to protect the king and connect the rooks for better defense.\n\n**En Passant (Taking on Pass)**\nEn passant is a special pawn capture. If your opponent moves a pawn two squares forward and lands next to your pawn, you can capture it on your next move as if it had moved only one square. Your pawn will take its place, but this capture must be done immediately.\n\n**Additional Features**\n\n* **Made a mistake?** Use the move undo function to reconsider your strategy.\n* After each match, a detailed analysis highlights mistakes and suggests better moves.\n* You can replay specific moments to strengthen your understanding of the game.\n* Save your rating and choose different time modes (Bullet, Blitz, Rapid).\n* Customize the board and pieces to your liking.\n* Review the move history and express your emotions by communicating with your opponent using playful cartoon emojis.",

      "howToPlayText": "**How to Play English Checkers**\n\nEnglish Checkers is a strategic board game where players aim to capture their opponent’s checkers or block them completely. Here’s how to get started and understand the basic rules:\n\n**Game Objective**\nThe goal is to either capture all of your opponent’s checkers or completely block them so they can’t make any legal moves.\n\n**Types of Checkers**\n- **Simple checker:** moves diagonally forward one square and can only capture forward.\n- **King:** can move diagonally both forward and backward on any free square and can capture in both directions. When a simple checker reaches the last row, it becomes a king and gains these additional abilities.\n\n**Basic Movement and Capture Rules**\n1. **Movement:**\n- simple checkers move diagonally forward one square at a time;\n- kings can move diagonally in any direction on any free square.\n\n2. **Capture:**\n- if your checker is next to your opponent’s checker and there’s an empty square behind it, you must jump over the opponent’s checker and land in the empty square, capturing the opponent’s piece;\n- captures are mandatory — if you have the option to capture, you must do so;\n- if a capture leads to another possible capture, you must continue capturing as part of the same turn until no more captures are possible;\n- when a simple checker reaches the last row during a capture, it becomes a king but cannot make further moves in the same turn.\n\n3. **Choosing Capture Options:**\n- if there are multiple capture options available, you can choose which one to make;\n- the «Turkish strike» rule means that a checker that has been beaten but not yet removed from the board can block the path of a king or another checker.\n\n**Winning the Game**\nYou win the game by:\n- capturing all of your opponent’s checkers;\n- blocking your opponent so that they have no legal moves left.\n\n**Getting Started in English Checkers Online Multiplayer**\n1. **Choose your game mode:** play against the computer, compete online with real players, or play with a friend on the same screen.\n2. **Select your difficulty level or opponent:** if playing against the computer, choose from 10 difficulty levels; if playing online, find a real opponent.\n3. **Choose your side:** select whether you want to play as black or white.\n4. **Start playing:** follow the rules of movement and capture to outmanoeuvre your opponent and achieve victory.\n\nEnjoy the game and sharpen your strategic skills with English Checkers Online Multiplayer!",
