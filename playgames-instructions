From each game card, you can:
Copy an affiliate link to share
Use a game link to embed a game via an iframe
Get the iframe code to embed the game directly
Download the game‚Äôs metadata as a JSON file
Get game assets as a ZIP archive or through a direct link
Add the game to your list to download multiple games in one JSON file
We also have widgets, with more details provided below.

Import the Game Catalog
Want to hand-pick games and embed them directly on your website or app? Here‚Äôs how to do it ‚Äî no hosting, no downloads, just copy and paste.
üéÆ How to Add the Games to Your Site
Step 1: Browse and Pick Games
Go to widgets.playgama.com
Sign up or log in to your account
If you‚Äôre not logged in, the games you collect will not include your unique CLID. After logging in, a CLID will be automatically added to your selected games.
Choose how you want to get games:
Download the full game catalog as a JSON file
Use filters to narrow down by genre, platform, or category ‚Äî or just scroll through and manually click the games you like.
Then click Download to get a custom file with your selected games.
Copy an individual game's embed code:
Open the game card and copy the iframe code to embed it directly on your site.
üñºÔ∏è If you‚Äôre using the iframe link and not downloading the JSON file, but still need visual assets (thumbnails or icons), you can:
Copy direct image links from the game card
Or download a ZIP archive with thumbnails and icons, also available on the game card

Step 2: Explore the JSON File
The JSON file contains all the game info you need ‚Äî title, genre, description, images, and most importantly:
Copy
"gameURL": "https://playgama.com/export/game/popping-candies"
This gameURL is the direct link used to embed the game on your site.

Step 3: Embed the Games
To add a game to your site, use the gameURL value like this:
Copy
<iframe src="https://playgama.com/export/game/popping-candies" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>
You‚Äôll need to add a separate <iframe> like this for each game you want to embed. Just replace the src with the corresponding gameURL from your JSON file.
You can change width and height to fit your layout.

‚úÖ That‚Äôs it! The game runs from our servers, so you don‚Äôt need to host anything ‚Äî just plug and play.
