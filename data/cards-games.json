      "description": "Durak is essentially a shedding card game where each player will try to get rid of the cards in their hand first. Durak is quite an enjoyable game that has over the years made a general impact on millions. It is a game that requires critical thinking, which is why it is more popular among people who consider themselves tech-savvy.\n\nThe objective of Durak is to play all your cards. The loser in Durak will be the last player with cards in their hand. So, to ensure you do not lose, try to act fast and get rid of your cards as soon as you can.\n\nDurak is the most popular Russian card game. Durak means fool and it refers to the person who loses the game.\n\nA Durak card game is one of the easiest and most fun card games. Players do not need much to get started. You will only need: a poker deck reduced to 36 cards from Ace to 6.\n\nHowever, this game is quite interesting because there will usually be multiple winners. To ensure you do not lose, try to act fast and get rid of your cards as soon as you can.\n\n\nDurak might not be a game you are overly familiar with. But in Russia, Durak is by far the most popular card game! It has got a fascinating history and will be sure to make a unique choice if you are looking for something a little different.\n\nAnother interesting thing about this game is that it is played with a smaller deck.\n\nDurak is fun and, rather, a unique card game. If you enjoy more strategic card games and are looking for something a little different, why not give Durak a try?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
      "howToPlayText": "Durak is played by 2 to 4 players. Total cards used are 36 cards - Only 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A of all suits are used.\n\nThe deck is shuffled, and each player is dealt with 6 cards. The bottom card of the stock is turned and placed face up on the table. The rest of the pack is then placed on half over the turn-up and at right angles to it, so that it remains visible. The trump suit is drawn as the last card.\n\nThe first person to play is the one who holds the lowest trump suit in his hand. The game proceeds in a clockwise direction. The player who started to play acts as an attacker and the player sitting next to him in a clockwise direction acts as a defender.\n\nThe player who has the lowest trump card will be the first attacker. If the attack succeeds, the defender loses their turn, and the attack passes to the player on the defender's left. If the attack fails, the defender becomes the next attacker. The attacker opens their turn by playing a card face up on the table as an attacking card. Defender responds to the attack with a defending card. A trump card of any rank beats all cards in the other three suits\n\nTo win Durak, you need to play all your cards quickly. Once you have played your cards, you are out of the game and will need to wait for the rest of the players. The last player with cards in their hand loses.",

      "description": "Dudes, this is a very short strategic card battle game that blends tactical gameplay with quirky humor and vibrant creativity. Build powerful armies, summon creatures, cast spells, and construct buildings across unique terrains in epic turn-based battles. What sets this game apart is its dynamic terrain system—each battlefield zone corresponds to specific card types, favoring attackers, healers, defenders, or versatile \"special units\" that can be placed anywhere! With customizable decks and deep strategic options, players must outwit their opponents to claim victory. Unlock new cards, upgrade your favorites heroes, and dominate the battlefield in this thrilling clash of wits and strategy. Let's go. In and out. After all, this is Card Quest: 10 Minute Adventure!",
      "howToPlayText": "• Deck Building: Before starting a match, create your deck using cards you’ve collected. Customize your deck based on strategy—focus on attack-heavy units, healing abilities, or powerful spells. \n• Terrain Zones: At the start of the game, choose which terrains to place on your side of the board. Each terrain type allows only certain creatures to be summoned there, except Rainbow Creatures, which are flexible. Terrain types:\n- Cornfields: Strong attackers.\n- Sandlands: Defensive powerhouses.\n- Blue Plains: Balanced but unpredictable.\n- Candy Kingdom: Weak but great at healing allies.\n- Useless Swamp: Special ability users or direct-damage dealers.\n• Turn-Based Mechanics: On your turn, draw cards, spend resources (Magic Points), and deploy creatures, buildings, or spells onto the field. Attack enemy creatures or target their towers directly when possible. \n• Winning Conditions: Outlast your opponent by maintaining stronger forces, controlling key areas, and dealing consistent damage. \n",

      "howToPlayText": "All heroes have 8 cards in the battle. There are 4 types of cards: Warriors, Berserkers, Hunters and Shamans. Simple cards (warriors) attack only with swords. To unlock the ability to attack with other cubes, it is necessary to increase the number of stars on the map, and chests will help in this. Also, as the stars increase, the damage it causes increases. The level of the card cannot be higher than the level of the hero, to increase the level of the card, you need the appropriate experience banks. All banks can be used only for simple cards. By putting on a thing, you increase the health of your hero. By wearing all 6 items, you can increase the hero's rank, which will also add health. If you don't have enough silver, use the wheel (by clicking on the silver from above), you can also find silver in the maze. You can gain experience for the hero level by completing daily tasks and winning raids. In the vastness of the game, you can get cans of energy to use them - click on the energy icon.",
