All models are made of pixel blocks including scenes, characters, and weapons. We have 4v4 Team Mode, Individual Mode, and Sniper Mode for you to select. If I were you, I would play the Team Mode first for better equipment, then challenge the other 2 modes when the rank levels up. If you never played any shooting games, I recommend you buy an auto-rifle to fight at any distance. Keep calm and shoot first!">
