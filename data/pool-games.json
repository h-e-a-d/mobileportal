      "description": "Pool 8 is a brain-teasing puzzle game based on a Pool board. \nPot the balls in the correct order to move through a series of increasingly difficult challenges!\n\nThere's a multitude of difficulty levels that you naturally progress through, starting with the easiest \"rookie\" level. At the end of each difficulty level, you get a chance to win extra retries in the \"smash the candies\" bonus round. You can also earn these by watching a short video ad.\nYes, but it starts out easy. As you progress, you reach higher difficulty levels.",
      "howToPlayText": "The unique mechanics in this game mean you can only move up, down, left, and right. \nThere are no diagonal movements, which poses a tricky challenge when several balls are on the table. \nThe key to winning the level is to think about the order of each move to ensure you can line up all the shots successfully.",
